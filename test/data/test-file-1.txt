Work Experience:

Software Engineer - Reckonsys Tech Labs | Dec 2023 - Present
     Worked on AI-powered CRM software to manage customer leads from multiple communication
     channels, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Email.
     Improved the Python backend for better database communication, using optimizations such as query
     tuning and caching, achieving a 10x speed increase while reducing database load.
     Integrated AI features into the CRM, enabling automation of tasks like lead classification, labeling, and
     generating auto-replies, reducing manual work and improving response times.
     Implemented CI/CD pipelines for a Django-based stack, enabling smooth and reliable deployments
     without downtime. This included automated testing and environment setup.
     Enhanced developer productivity by automating application setup, dependency management, and
     test data creation, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks.
     Built a Flutter web application to browse and purchase used cars in the UK, integrating with a car
     provider API for real-time data and ensuring a user-friendly interface.

Software Engineer Intern - Reckonsys Tech Labs | Dec 2023 - Present
     Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for an AI-powered chat assistant in a
     CRM.
     Built REST APIs to configure the AI assistant and enable seamless conversations.
     Managed the backend using Django, Dockerised the application, and handled multiple databases and
     a language model.

Education:
Priyadarshini College of Engineering and Technology - B.Tech | Apr 2019 - May 2023

     Graduated with a CGPA of 8.1, First Class with Distinction.
     Built a cloud-based quiz app for a college event. I built this overnight using Flutter and hosted it on
     Google Firebase. Users can register their team name. Admin manages users, turns the buzzer on or
     off, and can see the list of people who clicked the buzzer in time order. The event was very successful
     and the application received overwhelming praise.

Projects:

1. Application for Predicting Engineering College Admission for Class XII Students

Tech Stack - Python (Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Django), Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JS
      Developed an Engineering college prediction system for Class XII students that helps them find
      colleges they are likely to get admission into based on their entrance examination rank, area, caste,
      and gender.
      Administrators can view the data as well as train the Machine Learning model with additional data. My
      role focused mainly on backend development using Django and Python and training the model.

2. Data Science: Stock Price Prediction & Red Wine Analysis

Tech Stack - Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn), Jupyter Notebook
      Developed Machine Learning models for Stock Price Prediction and Red Wine Quality Estimation.
      I started by cleaning the datasets, performing Exploratory Data Analysis, and selecting the best
      features for training the model.
      The Stock Price Prediction model predicts the future price of a stock based on past trend. The Red
      Wine model uses features such as citric acid, density, residual sugars etc. to estimate quality of the
      wine.
      I used Python scikit-learn and achieved high efficiency in both models.

3. Setup a Chatbot with an LLM to Answer Questions on Books

Tech Stack - Python (H2OGPT, Discord Integration)
      Used h2oGPT, an open-source alternative to ChatGPT, and trained an LLM (Large Language Model)
      with a collection of books.
      Deployed the model in cloud and linked it to a bot that answers user queries about those books,
      summarises their content, and more functionalities. This project is done in collaboration with a team of
      Discord group members.

Awards/ Achievements:

      Scored highest District rank in International Maths Olympiad in Class IX.
      Received Govt. of A.P. Pratibha award in 10th and 12th classes for scoring top in Mandal.
      Achieved 99.6 percentile in JEE Mains Mathematics, with no extra preparation or tutoring support.

Hobbies / Interests:

      Running a Youtube channel on Mathematics for JEE aspirants with 5000+ subscribers and 6L+ views.
      Passionate about automation using Python and using AI, where applicable.
